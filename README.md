# Semester Study Assistant

Semester Study Assistant is a Java-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application
designed to help students manage their academic workflow.

It provides:
- Subject-wise study guidance based on syllabus
- Suggested revision topics
- Practice-style questions for self-learning
- A simple interactive interface using keyword detection

## 📚 Subjects Covered
- Java Programming
- Operating Systems
- Theory of Computation
- Python
- Applied Mathematics
- English Literature
- French
- Digital Marketing

## ⚙️ Built With
- Java (Core Concepts)
- Conditional Logic
- Methods & Modular Design

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was built to apply programming fundamentals to a real academic use case,
creating a lightweight assistant for structured semester study.

## 🚀 How It Works
User enters a query → program detects keywords → returns subject-specific guidance.

EXAMPLE: *Help me in Java
         *TOC Questions
         *Study OS

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add file-based session saving
- Expand question bank
- Convert into a Graphical User Interface version

Made as part of continuous learning and practical application of Java concepts.
